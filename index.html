         <h2>Dinosaur Age </h2>
       <p>Water lies in oceans, rivers, lakes, ponds, underground, glaciers, the atmosphere, and living things. Water sustains all lives on Earth as all organisms need water to survive. The same water is essentially reused ever since as it is cycled through evaporation, condensation, and precipitation since the start of life. </p>

       <h2>Early Farming Age </h2>
       <p>The use of water in agriculture enabled the formation of civilizations with the constant supply of food. This allowed the human population to grow as well as further development in technology.</p>

       <h2>Industrial Use of Water </h2>
       <p>Since the dawn of industrialization, water has proved essential for the working of factories and machinery. Both as a resource to run and cool machines and as a pit to soak all the industrial waste. This has affected the health of water by adding contaminants, affecting its pH and harming marine life. Freshwater that had various household uses has reduced in quantity due to industrial pollution.</p>

       <h2>Modern Daily Use of Water </h2>
       <p>Water has become an essential element in modern life (apart from the obvious need of its consumption to survive). It provides us with electricity and is important for cooking, cleaning, and bathing. Apart from that it has also seen its importance in leisurely activities taking place in swimming pools or even water parks. </p>

       <h2>Drought and Waste of Water </h2>
       <p>“An estimated 55 million people globally are affected by droughts every year. Water scarcity impacts 40% of the world’s population, and as many as 700 million people are at-risk of being displaced as a result of drought by 2030”(World Health Organization). Yet, the average family can waste “180 gallons per week, or 9,400 gallons of water annually, from household leaks”(United States Environmental Protection Agency).</p>

       <h2>Suggestions For Better Use of Water</h2>
       <p>For households, we can all use at least 20 percent less water by installing water-efficient fixtures and appliances. For example, we can use showerheads instead of bathtubs, install low-flow aerators on faucets, and use energy star rated dishwashers and washing machines. For industries, we can remove water from cleaning processes when a dry alternative is possible, reuse non-potable water for other operations, and replace outdated equipment with energy-efficient alternatives...</p>
