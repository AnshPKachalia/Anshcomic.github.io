Project Name: Comix Strip
 
Project Description: what is the project, what is the overall concept and theme, and what kind of experience you were striving to create?
>Talk about the story of water and highlight the ongoing impact of water pollution
>Raise awareness / highlight how humankind deteriorated water through its overuse and unsustainable allocation of water resources
>Takeaway would be conserving water and making better use of water. Be more aware of how water is used today.
>Meant as a childrenâ€™s comic to address a wider audience
>Used simple animated characters and gave voice to a water droplet to tell its own story
>Geared to inform younger audiences about the importance of conserving water
>Tried to create an interactive experience for the user
 
 
Process: How did you go about implementing the concept?
>Had an initial meeting and discussed topics we felt passionate about: Came up with a common topic of water conservation
>Discussed aspects that we felt comfortable about and thus divided the graphics and coding work accordingly
>Looked at various comic examples and read through Mccloud for inspiration
>Came up with the water droplet as a character and gave it its own voice.
>Using a chronological temporal approach to signify that water used by the dinosaurs is the same as the water we use today
>Set the position of the droplet as constant on the screen to justify the aforementioned
>The expression and colour of the droplet changes as you move ahead in time to highlight the deteriorating health of our current water supplies
>Clicking the image triggers a new image and repeated clicking converts into an action to add interactivity to the website
>Clicking the droplet gives a new dialogue each time
 
 
 
Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
 
>Our expectations of having a simplistic theme and feeling was met through the animation and easy navigation of our website. As the challenge for us initially was interactivity on the website, we did meet our expectations as our final product includes interactivity from clicking to move forward in dialogue and action. These interactions also incorporated the features of both comic and website as it requires user interaction through clicking while the graphics function as a comic.
>The theme is clear and well conveyed with simple English. We inform the readers with the misuse of water and ways to improve. A positive impact may be achieved after reading the comic.
>A possible improvement is a clearer way to invite the readers to both click on the droplet and the background image to see the interactivity of this project.
>We aimed to make the comic highly interactive and tried to achieve as much as we could based on our limited knowledge of Javascript. Having explored several new concepts through the course of this comic, we feel it was a great learning experience to grow as front-end developers and sharpen our skills in drawing and animation.
